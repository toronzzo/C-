      <H2>Introduction</H2></A>How does the Internet work? Good question! The 
      Internet's growth has become explosive and it seems impossible to escape 
      the bombardment of <I>www.com</I>'s seen constantly on television, heard 
      on radio, and seen in magazines. Because the Internet has become such a 
      large part of our lives, a good understanding is needed to use this new 
      tool most effectively. 
      <P>This whitepaper explains the underlying infrastructure and technologies 
      that make the Internet work. It does not go into great depth, but covers 
      enough of each area to give a basic understanding of the concepts 
      involved. For any unanswered questions, a list of resources is provided at 
      the end of the paper. Any comments, suggestions, questions, etc. are 
      encouraged and may be directed to the author at rshuler@gobcg.com. <A 
      name=addr>
      <H2>Where to Begin? Internet Addresses</H2></A>Because the Internet is a 
      global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet 
      <B>must</B> have a unique address. Internet addresses are in the form 
      <B>nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn</B> where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255. This 
      address is known as an IP address. (IP stands for Internet Protocol; more 
      on this later.) 
      <P>The picture below illustrates two computers connected to the Internet; 
      your computer with IP address 1.2.3.4 and another computer with IP address 
      5.6.7.8. The Internet is represented as an abstract object in-between. (As 
      this paper progresses, the Internet portion of Diagram 1 will be explained 
      and redrawn several times as the details of the Internet are exposed.)

      Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you are usually 
      assigned a temporary IP address for the duration of your dial-in session. 
      If you connect to the Internet from a local area network (LAN) your 
      computer might have a permanent IP address or it might obtain a temporary 
      one from a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. In any case, 
      if you are connected to the Internet, your computer has a unique IP 
      address.

        <TR>
          <TD><FONT face="arial, times new roman">If you're using Microsoft 
            Windows or a flavor of Unix and have a connection to the Internet, 
            there is a handy program to see if a computer on the Internet is 
            alive. It's called <B>ping</B>, probably after the sound made by 
            older submarine sonar systems.<SUP>1</SUP> If you are using Windows, 
            start a command prompt window. If you're using a flavor of Unix, get 
            to a command prompt. Type <FONT face=courier>ping 
            www.yahoo.com</FONT>. The ping program will send a 'ping' (actually 
            an ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request message) to 
            the named computer. The pinged computer will respond with a reply. 
            The ping program will count the time expired until the reply comes 
            back (if it does). Also, if you enter a domain name (i.e. 
            www.yahoo.com) instead of an IP address, ping will resolve the 
            domain name and display the computer's IP address. More on domain 
            names and address resolution later. 
      </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR><A name=stack>
      <H2>Protocol Stacks and Packets</H2></A>So your computer is connected to 
      the Internet and has a unique address. How does it 'talk' to other 
      computers connected to the Internet? An example should serve here: Let's 
      say your IP address is 1.2.3.4 and you want to send a message to the 
      computer 5.6.7.8. The message you want to send is "Hello computer 
      5.6.7.8!". Obviously, the message must be transmitted over whatever kind 
      of wire connects your computer to the Internet. Let's say you've dialed 
      into your ISP from home and the message must be transmitted over the phone 
      line. Therefore the message must be translated from alphabetic text into 
      electronic signals, transmitted over the Internet, then translated back 
      into alphabetic text. How is this accomplished? Through the use of a 
      <B>protocol stack</B>. Every computer needs one to communicate on the 
      Internet and it is usually built into the computer's operating system 
      (i.e. Windows, Unix, etc.). The protocol stack used on the Internet is 
      refered to as the TCP/IP protocol stack because of the two major 
      communication protocols used. The TCP/IP stack looks like this:

      the message "Hello computer 5.6.7.8!" took from our computer to the 
      computer with IP address 5.6.7.8, it would happen something like this:

      <OL>
        <LI>The message would start at the top of the protocol stack on your 
        computer and work it's way downward. 
        <LI>If the message to be sent is long, each stack layer that the message 
        passes through may break the message up into smaller chunks of data. 
        This is because data sent over the Internet (and most computer networks) 
        are sent in manageable chunks. On the Internet, these chunks of data are 
        known as <B>packets</B>. 
        <LI>The packets would go through the Application Layer and continue to 
        the TCP layer. Each packet is assigned a <B>port number</B>. Ports will 
        be explained later, but suffice to say that many programs may be using 
        the TCP/IP stack and sending messages. We need to know which program on 
        the destination computer needs to receive the message because it will be 
        listening on a specific port. 
        <LI>After going through the TCP layer, the packets proceed to the IP 
        layer. This is where each packet receives it's destination address, 
        5.6.7.8. 
        <LI>Now that our message packets have a port number and an IP address, 
        they are ready to be sent over the Internet. The hardware layer takes 
        care of turning our packets containing the alphabetic text of our 
        message into electronic signals and transmitting them over the phone 
        line. 
        <LI>On the other end of the phone line your ISP has a direct connection 
        to the Internet. The ISPs <B>router</B> examines the destination address 
        in each packet and determines where to send it. Often, the packet's next 
        stop is another router. More on routers and Internet infrastructure 
        later. 
        <LI>Eventually, the packets reach computer 5.6.7.8. Here, the packets 
        start at the bottom of the destination computer's TCP/IP stack and work 
        upwards. 
        <LI>As the packets go upwards through the stack, all routing data that 
        the sending computer's stack added (such as IP address and port number) 
        is stripped from the packets. 
        <LI>When the data reaches the top of the stack, the packets have been 
        re-assembled into their original form, "Hello computer 5.6.7.8!" 
      </LI></OL><A name=net_infra>
      <H2>Networking Infrastructure</H2></A>So now you know how packets travel 
      from one computer to another over the Internet. But what's in-between? 
      What actually makes up the Internet? Let's look at another diagram:

        <TR align=middle>
          <TD>Diagram 3 </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR></CENTER>Here we see Diagram 1 
      redrawn with more detail. The physical connection through the phone 
      network to the Internet Service Provider might have been easy to guess, 
      but beyond that might bear some explanation. 
      <P>The ISP maintains a pool of modems for their dial-in customers. This is 
      managed by some form of computer (usually a dedicated one) which controls 
      data flow from the modem pool to a backbone or dedicated line router. This 
      setup may be refered to as a port server, as it 'serves' access to the 
      network. Billing and usage information is usually collected here as well. 
      <P>After your packets traverse the phone network and your ISP's local 
      equipment, they are routed onto the ISP's backbone or a backbone the ISP 
      buys bandwidth from. From here the packets will usually journey through 
      several routers and over several backbones, dedicated lines, and other 
      networks until they find their destination, the computer with address 
      5.6.7.8. But wouldn't it would be nice if we knew the exact route our 
      packets were taking over the Internet? As it turns out, there is a way...

          <TD><FONT face="arial, times new roman">If you're using Microsoft 
            Windows or a flavor of Unix and have a connection to the Internet, 
            here is another handy Internet program. This one is called 
            <B>traceroute</B> and it shows the path your packets are taking to a 
            given Internet destination. Like ping, you must use traceroute from 
            a command prompt. In Windows, use <FONT face=courier>tracert 
            www.yahoo.com</FONT>. From a Unix prompt, type <FONT 
            face=courier>traceroute www.yahoo.com</FONT>. Like ping, you may 
            also enter IP addresses instead of domain names. Traceroute will 
            print out a list of all the routers, computers, and any other 
            Internet entities that your packets must travel through to get to 
            their destination. </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR>If you use 
      traceroute, you'll notice that your packets must travel through many 
      things to get to their destination. Most have long names such as 
      sjc2-core1-h2-0-0.atlas.digex.net and fddi0-0.br4.SJC.globalcenter.net. 
      These are Internet routers that decide where to send your packets. Several 
      routers are shown in Diagram 3, but only a few. Diagram 3 is meant to show 
      a simple network structure. The Internet is much more complex. 
      <P><A name=int_infra>
      <H2>Internet Infrastructure</H2></A>The Internet backbone is made up of 
      many large networks which interconnect with each other. These large 
      networks are known as <B>Network Service Providers</B> or <B>NSP</B>s. 
      Some of the large NSPs are UUNet, CerfNet, IBM, BBN Planet, SprintNet, 
      PSINet, as well as others. These networks <B>peer</B> with each other to 
      exchange packet traffic. Each NSP is required to connect to three 
      <B>Network Access Points</B> or <B>NAP</B>s. At the NAPs, packet traffic 
      may jump from one NSP's backbone to another NSP's backbone. NSPs also 
      interconnect at <B>Metropolitan Area Exchanges</B> or <B>MAE</B>s. MAEs 
      serve the same purpose as the NAPs but are privately owned. NAPs were the 
      original Internet interconnect points. Both NAPs and MAEs are referred to 
      as Internet Exchange Points or <B>IX</B>s. NSPs also sell bandwidth to 
      smaller networks, such as ISPs and smaller bandwidth providers. Below is a 
      picture showing this hierarchical infrastructure. <BR><BR>

      representation of an actual piece of the Internet. Diagram 4 is only meant 
      to demonstrate how the NSPs could interconnect with each other and smaller 
      ISPs. None of the physical network components are shown in Diagram 4 as 
      they are in Diagram 3. This is because a single NSP's backbone 
      infrastructure is a complex drawing by itself. Most NSPs publish maps of 
      their network infrastructure on their web sites and can be found easily. 
      To draw an actual map of the Internet would be nearly impossible due to 
      it's size, complexity, and ever changing structure. 
      <P><A name=route>
      <H2>The Internet Routing Hierarchy</H2></A>So how do packets find their 
      way across the Internet? Does every computer connected to the Internet 
      know where the other computers are? Do packets simply get 'broadcast' to 
      every computer on the Internet? The answer to both the preceeding 
      questions is 'no'. No computer knows where any of the other computers are, 
      and packets do not get sent to every computer. The information used to get 
      packets to their destinations are contained in routing tables kept by each 
      router connected to the Internet. 
      <P><B>Routers are packet switches.</B> A router is usually connected 
      between networks to route packets between them. Each router knows about 
      it's sub-networks and which IP addresses they use. The router usually 
      doesn't know what IP addresses are 'above' it. Examine Diagram 5 below. 
      The black boxes connecting the backbones are routers. The larger NSP 
      backbones at the top are connected at a NAP. Under them are several 
      sub-networks, and under them, more sub-networks. At the bottom are two 
      local area networks with computers attached. <BR><BR>

      at a router, the router examines the IP address put there by the IP 
      protocol layer on the originating computer. The router checks it's routing 
      table. If the network containing the IP address is found, the packet is 
      sent to that network. If the network containing the IP address is not 
      found, then the router sends the packet on a default route, usually up the 
      backbone hierarchy to the next router. Hopefully the next router will know 
      where to send the packet. If it does not, again the packet is routed 
      upwards until it reaches a NSP backbone. The routers connected to the NSP 
      backbones hold the largest routing tables and here the packet will be 
      routed to the correct backbone, where it will begin its journey 'downward' 
      through smaller and smaller networks until it finds it's destination. 
      <P><A name=dns>
      <H2>Domain Names and Address Resolution</H2></A>But what if you don't know 
      the IP address of the computer you want to connect to? What if the you 
      need to access a web server referred to as <I>www.anothercomputer.com</I>? 
      How does your web browser know where on the Internet this computer lives? 
      The answer to all these questions is the <B>Domain Name Service</B> or 
      <B>DNS</B>. The DNS is a distributed database which keeps track of 
      computer's names and their corresponding IP addresses on the Internet. 
      <P>Many computers connected to the Internet host part of the DNS database 
      and the software that allows others to access it. These computers are 
      known as DNS servers. No DNS server contains the entire database; they 
      only contain a subset of it. If a DNS server does not contain the domain 
      name requested by another computer, the DNS server re-directs the 
      requesting computer to another DNS server. <BR><BR>

          <TD>Diagram 6 </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><BR></CENTER>The Domain Name 
      Service is structured as a hierarchy similar to the IP routing hierarchy. 
      The computer requesting a name resolution will be re-directed 'up' the 
      hierarchy until a DNS server is found that can resolve the domain name in 
      the request. Figure 6 illustrates a portion of the hierarchy. At the top 
      of the tree are the domain roots. Some of the older, more common domains 
      are seen near the top. What is not shown are the multitude of DNS servers 
      around the world which form the rest of the hierarchy. 
      <P>When an Internet connection is setup (e.g. for a LAN or Dial-Up 
      Networking in Windows), one primary and one or more secondary DNS servers 
      are usually specified as part of the installation. This way, any Internet 
      applications that need domain name resolution will be able to function 
      correctly. For example, when you enter a web address into your web 
      browser, the browser first connects to your primary DNS server. After 
      obtaining the IP address for the domain name you entered, the browser then 
      connects to the target computer and requests the web page you wanted.

      <H2>Internet Protocols Revisited</H2></A>As hinted to earlier in the 
      section about protocol stacks, one may surmise that there are many 
      protocols that are used on the Internet. This is true; there are many 
      communication protocols required for the Internet to function. These 
      include the TCP and IP protocols, routing protocols, medium access control 
      protocols, application level protocols, etc. The following sections 
      describe some of the more important and commonly used protocols on the 
      Internet. Higher level protocols are discussed first, followed by lower 
      level protocols. <A name=http>
      <H2>Application Protocols: HTTP and the World Wide Web</H2></A>One of the 
      most commonly used services on the Internet is the World Wide Web (WWW). 
      The application protocol that makes the web work is <B>Hypertext Transfer 
      Protocol</B> or <B>HTTP</B>. Do not confuse this with the Hypertext Markup 
      Language (HTML). HTML is the language used to write web pages. HTTP is the 
      protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each 
      other over the Internet. It is an application level protocol because it 
      sits on top of the TCP layer in the protocol stack and is used by specific 
      applications to talk to one another. In this case the applications are web 
      browsers and web servers. 
      <P>HTTP is a connectionless text based protocol. Clients (web browsers) 
      send requests to web servers for web elements such as web pages and 
      images. After the request is serviced by a server, the connection between 
      client and server across the Internet is disconnected. A new connection 
      must be made for each request. Most protocols are connection oriented. 
      This means that the two computers communicating with each other keep the 
      connection open over the Internet. HTTP does not however. Before an HTTP 
      request can be made by a client, a new connection must be made to the 
      server. 
      <P>When you type a URL into a web browser, this is what happens: 
      <P>
      <OL>
        <LI>If the URL contains a domain name, the browser first connects to a 
        domain name server and retrieves the corresponding IP address for the 
        web server. 
        <LI>The web browser connects to the web server and sends an HTTP request 
        (via the protocol stack) for the desired web page. 
        <LI>The web server receives the request and checks for the desired page. 
        If the page exists, the web server sends it. If the server cannot find 
        the requested page, it will send an HTTP 404 error message. (404 means 
        'Page Not Found' as anyone who has surfed the web probably knows.) 
        <LI>The web browser receives the page back and the connection is closed. 

        <LI>The browser then parses through the page and looks for other page 
        elements it needs to complete the web page. These usually include 
        images, applets, etc. 
        <LI>For each element needed, the browser makes additional connections 
        and HTTP requests to the server for each element. 
        <LI>When the browser has finished loading all images, applets, etc. the 
        page will be completely loaded in the browser window. </LI></OL>

</PRE></FONT>This SMTP transaction is taken from RFC 821, which specifies 
      SMTP. <A name=tcp>
      <H2>Transmission Control Protocol</H2></A>Under the application layer in 
      the protocol stack is the TCP layer. When applications open a connection 
      to another computer on the Internet, the messages they send (using a 
      specific application layer protocol) get passed down the stack to the TCP 
      layer. <B>TCP is responsible for routing application protocols to the 
      correct application on the destination computer</B>. To accomplish this, 
      port numbers are used. Ports can be thought of as seperate channels on 
      each computer. For example, you can surf the web while reading e-mail. 
      This is because these two applications (the web browser and the mail 
      client) used different port numbers. When a packet arrives at a computer 
      and makes its way up the protocol stack, the TCP layer decides which 
      application receives the packet based on a port number. 
      <P>TCP works like this: 
      <P>
      <UL>
        <LI>When the TCP layer receives the application layer protocol data from 
        above, it segments it into manageable 'chunks' and then adds a TCP 
        header with specific TCP information to each 'chunk'. The information 
        contained in the TCP header includes the port number of the application 
        the data needs to be sent to. 
        <LI>When the TCP layer receives a packet from the IP layer below it, the 
        TCP layer strips the TCP header data from the packet, does some data 
        reconstruction if necessary, and then sends the data to the correct 
        application using the port number taken from the TCP header. 
      </LI></UL>This is how TCP routes the data moving through the protocol 
      stack to the correct application. 
      <P>TCP is not a textual protocol. <B>TCP is a connection-oriented, 
      reliable, byte stream service</B>. Connection-oriented means that two 
      applications using TCP must first establish a connection before exchanging 
      data. TCP is reliable because for each packet received, an acknowledgement 
      is sent to the sender to confirm the delivery. TCP also includes a 
      checksum in it's header for error-checking the received data. The TCP 
      header looks like this: <BR><BR>

      no place for an IP address in the TCP header. This is because TCP doesn't 
      know anything about IP addresses. TCP's job is to get application level 
      data from application to application reliably. The task of getting data 
      from computer to computer is the job of IP.
